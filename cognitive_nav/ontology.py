        # Classification rules

        # TODO:
        # Add OWL equivalence rules that allow the reasoner
        # to infer the room type from the observed objects.

        # Example:
        # LivingRoom.equivalent_to.append(
        #     Room
        #     & contains.some(Sofa)
        # )

        # Example rule:

        # Bedroom.equivalent_to.append(
        #     Room
        #     & contains.some(Bed)
        # )

        # Try to make your rules specific enough to avoid
        # confusing one room with another.
